# HackTX 2023 - Otterblox
Otterblox is a lego-build finder app that gives you new build ideas based on the lego pieces you already have - just from a picture. A trained Lego object detection model integrated with Lego's Rebrickable API analyzes your image of legos and identifies lego piece matches by ID. Python used for computer vision + backend, Swift/Objective-C for a frontend iOS app. Dataset managed by MongoDB.

Future development: Intend to integrate an LLM-powered query system for more personalized build ideas. Expand lego image dataset for training.
